##Build Epicodus in Rails!

###Epicodus bootcamp exercise

The objective of this exercise is to build a clone of <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com">Epicodus.com</a> website. This is the third Rails 4 project that we will be doing.  I missed class today and am doing it from my hotel room.  

My objects:

* First, work on CRUD/L functionality for lessons. A lesson has a name and some text content. Don't worry about videos and cheat sheets.

* Next, we need to get the order of the lessons in. Each lesson has a number. When you click Next lesson at the bottom of the page, it goes to the lesson with the next-highest number.

* Of course we will use test driven development throughout.

* The lesson plan says to simple have each lesson show text, however, I would like to practice <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> so I will be attempting to use the bootstrap Tabs and style the pages like the Epicodus pages.
